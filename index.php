        The purpose of the OSU Robotics Club is to empower ambitious students with resources to build robots for fun and competition, remove barriers from entry into robotics, create a path to success, and form a pipeline of engineering leaders.
        <br><br>
        We welcome students of all majors and engineering disciplines. Our members participate in international competitions against university and professional teams.
        <br><br>
        We host both internal projects geared toward the beginner, as well as external projects which encompass all levels of knowledge and skill.
