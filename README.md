OSU Robotics Club Webite
=========
The purpose of the OSU Robotics Club is to empower ambitious students with resources to build robots for fun and competition, remove barriers from entry into robotics, create a path to success, and form a pipeline of engineering leaders.

We welcome students of all majors and engineering disciplines. Our members participate in international competitions against university and professional teams.

We host both internal projects geared toward the beginner, as well as external projects which encompass all levels of knowledge and skill.
